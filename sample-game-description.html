      Destiny is an online sci-fi first-person shooter developed by <a href="/bungie/3010-476/" data-ref-id="3010-476">Bungie</a> and published by <a href="/activision/3010-78/" data-ref-id="3010-78">Activision</a> for the <a href="/xbox-one/3045-145/" data-ref-id="3045-145">Xbox One</a>, <a href="/playstation-4/3045-146/" data-ref-id="3045-146">PlayStation 4</a>, <a href="/xbox-360/3045-20/" data-ref-id="3045-20">Xbox 360</a>, and <a href="/playstation-3/3045-35/" data-ref-id="3045-35">PlayStation 3</a> on September 9, 2014. It marks Bungie's first foray away from the <a href="/halo/3025-2/" data-ref-id="3025-2">Halo</a> series since its creation (and its first game for Sony consoles since <a href="/oni/3030-17168/" data-ref-id="3030-17168">Oni</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Set over 700 years into the future (after a period of technological advancement known as the Golden Age, thanks to a mysterious orb known as "The Traveler"), a mysterious event (known as "the Collapse") has decimated human colonies throughout the galaxy. With the last surviving human city on <a href="/earth/3035-65/" data-ref-id="3035-65">Earth</a> defended by The Guardians (warriors who have unique abilities granted by The Traveler), players take control of a customizable Guardian, who must investigate the solar system and destroy a variety of alien threats before humanity is wiped out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game includes a variety of <a href="/role-playing-shooter/3015-3938/" data-ref-id="3015-3938">RPG</a> elements, as players level up their Guardian and maintain an inventory gained by acquiring loot (by killing enemies, completing tasks, and buying from vendors). Along with a standard free-roaming mode (known as Patrol) and a campaign, players can team up for quick three-man co-operative missions (known as Strike) or a very long six-man co-operative mission (known as <a href="/raid/3015-247/" data-ref-id="3015-247">Raid</a>). Players can also team up against other players in the Crucible mode.

      Unlike Bungie's past work, Destiny is built around custom characters. The game has a class-based system, and three classes--Hunter, Titan, and Warlock. In addition to firing rifles, pistols, rocket launchers, and sniper rifles, players will also have access to magic-like abilities, granted by the Traveler.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three weapons can be equipped at a time, and more can be carried in the inventory. The three slots are called "primary", "special", and "heavy". Every player also has a small speeder bike vehicle currently called the Sparrow and can be used to traverse larger areas. Characters will also have access to their own customizable spaceship, but it will not be player controlled nor will there be space combat. It's more of a means to fast travel. Glimmer, small blue bits that drop from killed enemies, is a currency needed to buy new weapons, pieces of armor, vehicles, and other cosmetic items as well as upgrade some weapons and armor.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an online-only game, Destiny will feature separate, third-person social spaces where players can collect, group up, and prepare for the missions ahead. Some mission zones will also be public spaces, allowing for players to encounter each other while out in the field and group up on-the-fly. Bungie has stated that the goal is to not show lobbies, matchmaking, or connection screens, instead delivering a more seamless experience. Player-versus-player combat will not be a factor out in the general world, but instead the game features The Crucible, a special location that is traveled to by players in order to participate in PVP gametypes. Player counts for public spaces are not known at this time and will likely vary depending on the platform and network connection of the player.

      Destiny is a loot driven game. Weapons, armor, and wearable items can be found in the world when players are on a mission or just exploring, bought from various vendors at The Tower, gained as rewards for completing challenges, or randomly received for competing in The Crucible. When loot is collected from a killed enemy only one player needs to run over the glowing orb representing the loot and it will automatically be distributed among the group if the player isn't alone. All armor and clothing items will have properties that effect gameplay. Exotic gear is the name Bungie has given to rare items within the world of Destiny. These items will have a unique look to them and special names.
    </p>
    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>
      Some time ago, there was once a Golden Age of human spacefaring. A mysterious orb called The Traveler made its way to Earth, jumpstarting human technology and allowing them to colonize the worlds of the Solar System. But humanity was eventually pushed back by some unknown force, only surviving by the intervention and "sacrifice" of The Traveler, below which now sits humankind's last remaining settlement, a lone city.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, in the present time, humans have managed to recover their technology to the point of being able to travel into space again, but they discover that their former colonies have now become occupied by several alien races, who are pushing towards conquering the last human city. Warriors known as Guardians are tasked with protecting the city and fighting against the aliens to order to restore humanity to its former glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ghost, voiced by Game of Thrones star Peter Dinklage, is a customizable AI companion issued to every Guardian in The City. It/He assists the player in different ways, like unlocking doors, turning on a building's lights, or warning of incoming enemies.

    <h2>Player Classes</h2>
    <p>There are three classes in Destiny: the Hunter, the Warlock, and the Titan. All classes can use "space magic", and all classes can use all weapon types. A class is described by Bungie as a choice to "fine tune" your Guardian so that there will be little regret in a player's choice. Each class is customized within two subclasses, able to be changed on the fly. Once locked in a duplicate subclass will unlock, to encourage experimentation. Further players are able to have multiple characters.</p>
    <h3>Hunter</h3>

    <p>A combination of speed and strength, their signature weapons appear to be sniper rifles and revolvers. Hunters can be recognized by their hooded capes and relatively light armor. Before becoming Guardians, Hunters were once outlaws who roamed the wastelands.</p>
    <p>They were designed to invoke the image of a Wild West outlaw and the classic bounty hunter. Some of their inspirations were <a href="/han-solo/3005-3260/" data-ref-id="3005-3260">Han Solo</a> and Clint Eastwood's Man with No Name.</p>
    <p><strong>Gunslinger</strong>: Golden Gun - "Summon a flaming pistol which disintegrates enemies with Solar Light."</p>
    <p><strong>Bladedancer</strong>: Arc Blade - "Charge your blade with Arc Light and consume your foes with lightning."</p>

    <p>Guardians who have long studied the Traveler and are able to wield its gifts of "magic", alongside modern weaponry. Warlocks can be recognized by their long coats and rounded helmets.</p>
    <p>They were designed to invoke the image of a "space wizard". Some of their inspirations were <a href="/the-jedi/3015-655/" data-ref-id="3015-655">Jedi Knights</a>, <a href="/gandalf/3005-1535/" data-ref-id="3005-1535">Gandalf</a>, and <a href="/morpheus/3005-2690/" data-ref-id="3005-2690">Morpheus</a>.</p>

    <p>Guardians who specialize in heavy armor and powerful weaponry. The first Titans built The Wall which protects the last city. Titans can be recognized by their full body armor and swept-back helmets.</p>
    <p>They were designed to invoke the image of the classic future soldier. Some of their inspirations include Halo's Master Chief, Stormtroopers from Star Wars, and other space marines from sci-fi.</p>
    <p><strong>Striker</strong>: Fist of Havoc - Smash the ground and dissolve nearby enemies in a maelstrom of Arc Light.</p>
